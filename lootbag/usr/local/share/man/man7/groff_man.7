.P
An empty macro argument can be specified with a pair of double-quotes
(""),
but the
.I man
package is designed such that this should seldom be necessary.
.
Most macro arguments will be formatted as text in the output;
exceptions are noted.
.
.
.\" ====================================================================
.SS "Document structure macros"
.\" ====================================================================
.
Document structure macros organize a man page's content.
.
All of them break the output line.
.
.B .TH
(title heading)
identifies the document as a man page and configures the page headers
and footers.
.
Section headings
.RB ( .SH ),
one of which is mandatory and many of which are conventionally expected,
facilitate location of material by the reader and aid the man page
writer to discuss all essential aspects of the topic.
.
Subsection headings
.RB ( .SS )
are optional and permit sections that grow long to develop in a
controlled way.
.
Many technical discussions benefit from examples;
lengthy ones,
especially those reflecting multiple lines of input to or output from
the system,
are usefully bracketed by
.B .EX
and
.BR .EE .
.
When none of the foregoing meets a structural demand,
use
.BR .RS / .RE
to inset a region within a (sub)section.
.
.
.TP
.BI .TH " topic section"\c
.RI " [" footer-middle ]\c
.RI " [" footer-inside ]\c
.RI " [" header-middle ]
Determine the contents of the page header and footer.
.
The subject of the man page is
.I topic
and the section of the manual to which it belongs is
.I section.
.
See
.MR man 1
or
.MR intro 1
for the manual sectioning applicable to your system.
.
.I topic
and
.I section
are positioned together at the left and right in the header
(with
.I section
in parentheses immediately appended to
.IR topic ).
.
.I footer-middle
is centered in the footer.
.
The arrangement of the rest of the footer depends on whether
double-sided layout is enabled with the option
.BR \-rD1 .
.
When disabled (the default),
.I footer-inside
is positioned at the bottom left.
.
Otherwise,
.I footer-inside
appears at the bottom left on recto (odd-numbered) pages,
and at the bottom right on verso (even-numbered) pages.
.
The outside footer is the page number,
except in the continuous-rendering mode enabled by the option
.BR \-rcR=1 ,
in which case it is the
.I topic
and
.I section,
as in the header.
.
.I header-middle
is centered in the header.
.
If
.I section
is an integer between 1 and\~9 (inclusive),
there is no need to specify
.I header-middle;
.I an.tmac
will supply text for it.
.
The macro package may also abbreviate
.I topic
and
.I footer-inside
with ellipses
if they would overrun the space available in the header and footer,
respectively.
.
For HTML output,
headers and footers are suppressed.
.
.
.IP
Additionally,
this macro breaks the page,
resetting the number to\~1
(unless the
.B \-rC1
option is given).
.
This feature is intended only for formatting multiple
.I man
documents in sequence.
.
.
.IP
A valid
.I man
document calls
.B .TH
once,
early in the file,
prior to any other macro calls.
.
.
.TP
.BR .SH " ["\c
.IR heading-text ]
Set
.I heading-text
as a section heading.
.
If no argument is given,
a one-line input trap is planted;
text on the next line
.\", which can be formatted with a macro, \" true but discouraged
becomes
.I heading-text.
.
The left margin is reset to zero to set the heading text in bold
(or the font specified by the string
.BR HF ),
and,
on typesetting devices,
slightly larger than the base type size.
.
If the heading font
.B \[rs]*[HF]
is bold,
use of an italic style in
.I heading-text
is mapped to the bold-italic style if available in the font family.
.
The inset level is reset to 1,
setting the left margin to the value of the
.B IN \" TODO: future: BP or BI register ("base paragraph indentation")
register.
.
Text after
.I heading-text
is set as an ordinary paragraph
.RB ( .P ).
.
.
.IP
The content of
.I heading-text
and ordering of sections follows a set of common practices,
as has much of the layout of material within sections.
.
For example,
a section called \(lqName\(rq or \(lqNAME\(rq must exist,
must be the first section after the
.B .TH
call,
and must contain only text of the form

.\" ====================================================================
.SS "Paragraphing macros"
.\" ====================================================================
.
An ordinary paragraph
.RB ( .P )
is set without a first-line indentation at the current left margin.
.
In man pages and other technical literature,
definition lists are frequently encountered;
these can be set as \(lqtagged paragraphs\(rq,
which have one
.RB ( .TP )
or more
.RB ( .TQ )
leading tags followed by a paragraph that has an additional indentation.
.
The indented paragraph
.RB ( .IP )
macro is useful to continue the indented content of a narrative started
with
.BR .TP ,
or to present an itemized or ordered list.
.
All of these macros break the output line.
.
If another paragraph macro has occurred since the previous
.B .SH
or
.BR .SS ,
they
(except for
.BR .TQ )
follow the break with a default amount of vertical space,
which can be changed by the deprecated
.B .PD
macro;
see subsection \(lqHorizontal and vertical spacing\(rq below.
.
They also reset the type size and font style to defaults
.RB ( .TQ
again excepted);
see subsection \(lqFont style macros\(rq below.
.
.
.br
.ne 4v
.TP
.B .P

.B .RS
and
.BR .RE ,
is not.
.
.
.TP
.BR .TP " ["\c
.IR indentation ]
Set a paragraph with a leading tag,
and the remainder of the paragraph indented.
.
A one-line input trap is planted;
text on the next line,
which can be formatted with a macro,
becomes the tag,
which is placed at the current left margin.
.
The tag can be extended with the
.B \(rsc
escape sequence.
.
Subsequent text is indented by
.I indentation,
if specified,
and by the amount of the
.B IN
register otherwise.
.
If the tag is not as wide as the indentation,
the paragraph starts on the same line as the tag,
at the applicable indentation,
and continues on the following lines.
.
Otherwise,
the descriptive part of the paragraph begins on the line following the
tag.
.

Set an additional tag for a paragraph tagged with

.
Italic text is usually set underscored instead on terminal devices.
.
The

.SS Hooks
.\" ====================================================================
.
Two macros,
both GNU extensions,\" from groff 1.19
are called internally by the
.I groff man
package to format page headers and footers and can be redefined by the
administrator in a site's
.I man.local
file
(see section \(lqFiles\(rq below).
.
The presentation of
.B .TH
above describes the default headers and footers.
.
Because these macros are hooks for
.I groff man
internals,
man pages have no reason to call them.
.
Such hook definitions will likely consist of \[lq].sp\[rq] and
\[lq].tl\[rq] requests.
.
They must also increase the page length with \[lq].pl\[rq] requests in
continuous rendering mode;
.B .PT
furthermore has the responsibility of emitting a PDF bookmark after
writing the first page header in a document.
.
Consult the existing implementations in
.I an.tmac
when drafting replacements.
.
.
.TP
.B .BT
Set the page footer text
(\(lqbottom trap\(rq).
.
.
.TP
.B .PT
Set the page header text
(\(lqpage trap\(rq).

.P
To remove a page header or footer entirely,
define the appropriate macro as empty rather than deleting it.

you should probably be composing a table using
.MR \%tbl 1
instead.

Use of this presentation-oriented macro is deprecated.
.
A hanging indentation cannot be expressed naturally under HTML,
and
.RI non- roff -based
man page interpreters may treat
.B .HP
as an ordinary paragraph.
.
Thus,
information or distinctions you mean to express with indentation may be
lost.

It cannot easily be used to annotate options that take optional
arguments or options whose arguments have internal structure
(such as a mixture of literal and variable components).

recognized and used by the
.I man
macro package.
.
To ensure rendering consistent with output device capabilities and
reader preferences,
man pages should never manipulate them.
.
.
.TP
.BI \-dAD= adjustment-mode
Set line adjustment to
.I adjustment-mode,
which is typically
.RB \[lq] b \[rq]
for adjustment to both margins
(the default),
or
.RB \[lq] l \[rq]
for left alignment
(ragged right margin).
.
Any valid argument to
.IR groff 's
\[lq].ad\[rq] request may be used.
.
See
.MR groff 7
for less-common choices.
.
.
.TP
.B \-rcR=1
Enable continuous rendering.
.
Output is not paginated;
instead,
one
(potentially very long)
page is produced.
.
This is the default for terminal and HTML devices.
.
Use
.B \-rcR=0
to disable it on terminal devices;
on HTML devices,
it cannot be disabled.
.
.
.TP
.B \-rC1
Number output pages consecutively,
in strictly increasing sequence,
rather than resetting the page number to\~1
(or the value of register
.BR P )
with each new
.I man
document.
.
.
.TP
.B \-rCS=1
Set section headings
(the argument(s) to
.BR .SH )
in full capitals.
.
This transformation is off by default because it discards case
distinction information.
.
.
.TP
.B \-rCT=1
Set the man page topic
(the first argument to
.BR .TH )
in full capitals in headers and footers.
.
This transformation is off by default because it discards case
distinction information.
.
.
.TP
.B \-rD1
Enable double-sided layout,
formatting footers for even and odd pages differently;
see the description of
.B .TH
in subsection \(lqDocument structure macros\(rq above.
.
.
.TP
.BI \-rFT= footer-distance
Set distance of the footer relative to the bottom of the page to
.I footer-distance;
this amount is always negative.
.
At one half-inch above this location,
the page text is broken before writing the footer.
.
Ignored if continuous rendering is enabled.
.
The default is \-0.5i.
.
.
.TP
.BI \-dHF= heading-font
Set the font used for section and subsection headings;
the default is
.RB \(lq B \(rq
(bold style of the default family).
.
Any valid argument to
.IR groff 's
\[lq].ft\[rq] request may be used.
.
See
.MR groff 7 .

.TP
.B \-rHY=0
Disable automatic hyphenation.

The hyphenation mode is determined by the
.I groff
locale;
see section \[lq]Localization\[lq] of
.MR groff 7 .
.

.RB ( .P
and its synonyms)
and the default indentation amount used by
.BR .IP ,
.BR .RS ,
.BR .TP ,
.\" .TQ inherits its indentation from the preceding .TP.
and the deprecated
.BR .HP .
.
See subsection \(lqHorizontal and vertical spacing\(rq above for the
default.

For
terminal devices,
.I standard-indentation
should always be an integer multiple of unit \(lqn\(rq to get consistent
indentation.

.TP
.BI \-rLL= line-length
Set line length;
the default is 78n for terminal devices
and 6.5i for typesetting devices.
.
.
.TP
.BI \-rLT= title-length
Set the line length for titles.
.
By default,
it is set to the line length

.BI \-dMF= man-page-topic-font
Set the font used for man page topics named in
.B .TH
and
.B .MR
calls;
the default is
.RB \(lq I \(rq
(italic style of the default family).
.
Any valid argument to
.IR groff 's
\[lq].ft\[rq] request may be used.
.
If the
.B MF
string ends in \[lq]I\[rq],
it is assumed to be an oblique typeface,
and italic corrections are applied before and after man page topics.

.BI \-rP n
Start enumeration of pages at
.IR n .
.
The default is\~1.

.TP
.B \-rU1
Enable generation of URI hyperlinks in the
.I grohtml
and
.I grotty
output drivers.
.
.I grohtml
enables them by default;
.I grotty
does not,
pending more widespread pager support for OSC\~8 escape sequences.

Use
.B \-rU0
to disable hyperlinks;
this will make the arguments to
.B MT
and
.B UR
calls visible in the document text produced by link-capable drivers.

.TP
.BI \-rX p
Number successors of
.RI page\~ p
as
.IR p a,
.IR p b,
.IR p c,
